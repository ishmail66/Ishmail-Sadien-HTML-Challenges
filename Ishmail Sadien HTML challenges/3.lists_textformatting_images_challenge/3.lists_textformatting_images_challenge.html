    <em><strong><u><h2>Method</h2><u><em><strong>
</em>
  <br>
<ol>
<li>Pick the coriander leaves and finely slice the stalks, then keep aside for later. Peel and finely slice the garlic, then peel and matchstick the ginger.
</li>
<li>Trim and finely slice the spring onions, deseed and finely slice the chilli and cut the lime into wedges. Trim, peel and thinly slice the carrots at an angle.
</li>
<li>Cut the broccoli into small florets, then finely shred the stalk, discarding any gnarly bits. Cut the chicken into 1cm strips.
</li>
<li>Cook the noodles according to packet instructions, then drain and refresh under cold water. Drain again, toss in a little oil and put to one side. Lightly toast the cashew nuts in a non-stick frying pan until golden, then tip onto a plate to cool.
</li>
<li>Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large frying pan or wok. Season the chicken with a pinch of pepper, then add to the pan and stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden. Add the coriander stalks, garlic and ginger and cook for a further minute.
</li>
<li>Add the spring onions, carrots and broccoli and stir-fry for a further 2 minutes, then add the cooked noodles. Keep stir-frying until the noodles are warm and the chicken is cooked through. Stir through the soy and fish sauces, then remove from the heat.</li>
<li>Divide between bowls, sprinkle over the nuts, sliced chilli and the reserved coriander leaves, then serve with the lime wedges for squeezing over.</li>

  Riesling and riesling blends.
  Torrontes from Argentina - an interesting alternative to riesling.
  Fruity Australian whites especially ones containing semillon and colombard.
  New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc - particularly with stir-fries that contain veggies like asparagus, peppers and mangetout.</em></center>
